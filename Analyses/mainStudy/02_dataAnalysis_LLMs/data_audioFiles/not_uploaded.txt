Audio files of voice recordings are not uploaded in order to protect individual privacy and maintain data security. Human voice contains biometric identifiers—such as pitch patterns, formant frequencies, and speech dynamics—that can be used for speaker recognition and identity verification. From a scientific and ethical standpoint, voice data is classified as sensitive biometric information because it can potentially reveal personal identity, emotional state, health conditions, and demographic characteristics. Therefore, avoiding the upload of voice recordings minimizes the risk of unauthorized access, data misuse, and potential breaches of confidentiality.
