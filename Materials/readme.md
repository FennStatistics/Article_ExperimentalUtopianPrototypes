    2. **discussing initial coding guidelines**: the coding guidelines were discussed (see protocol of team discussion)
    3. **adjustement of coding guidelines**: based on 2. and further discussion between two main authors the coding guidelines were respectively adjusted
    4. **applying coding guidelines**: the final coding guidelines were applied by seven raters to the complete data set, whereby X% percent of words were overlapping to test for inter-rater reliability
        + finally the ratings were slightly adjusted by the two main authors, because of X
