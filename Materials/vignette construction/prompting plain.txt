Using ONLY the sources in this notebook, define “{{Utopia_Prototype}}” as used in the literature.
•	Give a 4–6 sentence definition.
•	List 8 defining features (bullet points) of the “{{Utopia_Prototype}}”.
•	List 3 adjacent Utopias and explain in 1 sentence each how they differ.
•	Extract 5 short quotes (≤25 words each) that best anchor the definition, with source + page/section.

Extract prototype “attribute cards” (key factors) for “{{Utopia_Prototype}}”
Output a compact card with:
•	Core organizing principle (1 sentence) of the “{{Utopia_Prototype}}”
•	Key factors — 8 bullet points
•	Mechanism sentence: “Because X, society achieves Y via Z.”
•	Do-not-include / exclusions (3 bullets) to prevent overlap with other Utopias (the seven Utopias considered are Futurist Utopia, AI-Centered Utopia, Primitivist (Arcadian) Utopia, Modern Green Utopia, Religious (Millennial) Utopia, Institutional (Law-Based) Utopia, Moral Commonwealth (Anarchic) Utopia)
•	Plausibility anchors: 2–3 notes on what makes it feel possible (no evaluation)
•	Extract the 4 content dimensions (with citations, verbatim or close paraphrase if possible) and present them as a separate block titled “Content dimensions” using exactly these labels how the “{{Utopia_Prototype}}” is contributing to:
+ Desirability: inherent attractiveness/personal appeal/idealness; foundational but insufficient alone for critique/change
+ Beneficence: moral/pro-social; welfare/rights/greater good
+ Innovative: specificity/novelty; provides “how” of transformation
+ Possible: perceived achievability (not probability/certainty); psychological investment in realization

Take your previous “{{Utopia_Prototype}}” outputs and rewrite it as a SPECIFIC, OPERATIONALIZED attribute card suitable for vignette construction and manipulation checks.

Rules:

•	Keep the same headings, but make every bullet concrete and testable (i.e., something a reader could point to in a vignette). Avoid abstract words unless you immediately specify how it appears.
•	For each of the 8 key factors, provide three subfields:
+ Indicator (what readers would notice): one short clause
+ Implementation (how the society does it): one short clause
+ Boundary condition (what it does NOT imply): one short clause
•	Add a section “Signature institutions / artifacts (pick 5)”: name 5 concrete institutions or artifacts that uniquely signal “{{Utopia_Prototype}}”, each with 1-line description.
•	Add a section “Confusability risks”: list 3 ways it could be mistaken for other utopias and how to avoid that in wording (the seven Utopias considered are Futurist Utopia, AI-Centered Utopia, Primitivist (Arcadian) Utopia, Modern Green Utopia, Religious (Millennial) Utopia, Institutional (Law-Based) Utopia, Moral Commonwealth (Anarchic) Utopia).

PROTOTYPE TO WRITE
- Utopia_Prototype label: {{Modern Green Utopia}}


You are assisting with experimental stimulus writing for a within-subject study on Utopian Prototypes. 
Write ONE vignette for the prototype specified below.

HARD CONSTRAINTS (must follow exactly)
1) Use ONLY the information in the RAG OUTPUT below. Do NOT add facts, examples, institutions, technologies, or assumptions that are not explicitly stated there.
2) Audience: lay participants. Use plain language, short sentences, and avoid jargon. If a technical term appears in RAG OUTPUT, explain it in everyday terms in the same sentence.
3) Length: 100 words total (±5 words).
4) Structure: EXACTLY 7 sentences, with the following functions:
   - Introduction (Sentences 1–2): Introduce the society’s core organizing principle of the “{{Utopia_Prototype}}” and what it looks like in everyday life. Use familiar references (e.g., “like a public service you already know”) rather than technical detail.
   - Main Text (Sentences 3–5): Describe how the society actually works in accessible language. Include:
        (a) at least 2 of the prototype’s KEY FACTORS as concrete, observable features,
        (b) exactly 1 explicit mechanism statement in plain language that mirrors: “Because X, society achieves Y via Z.”
   - Conclusion (Sentences 6–7): State the societal relevance (what this organization principle changes in daily coordination) and restate the organizing principle in neutral terms.
5) Manipulation fidelity (1 sentence):
   - Include at least 1 “signature institution/artifact” if provided in RAG OUTPUT.
   - Respect all “Do-not-include / exclusions” from RAG OUTPUT (do not accidentally overlap with other utopias).
6) Output: Return ONLY the vignette text (no headings, no bullet points, no metadata).
