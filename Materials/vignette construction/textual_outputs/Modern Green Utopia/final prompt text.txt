RAG OUTPUT (authoritative source material):

The **Modern Green Utopia** is an ideal society characterized by **ecological modernization**, where **sustainable technology** and clean energy are used to reconcile human development with the preservation of the biosphere. It is built upon the **principle of sufficiency**, aiming for a state of "just enough" material wealth to eliminate poverty while rejecting the waste of over-consumption. This model often envisions **urbanized environments** that integrate natural habitats, plants, and animals into a well-functioning cityscape. A defining psychological feature of this prototype is its reliance on **participative efficacy**, fostering the belief that ordinary people can and must actively engage in constructing a better world. It is governed by **laws and institutions** designed to maintain a stable, harmonious balance between social needs and ecological limits.

**Defining Features**
*   **Ecological Modernization:** The inventive use of **modern technology** (e.g., solar and wind power) is considered crucial to solving environmental crises.
*   **Material Sufficiency:** Society aims for "just enough" to share fairly, ensuring the **eradication of poverty** without seeking limitless material growth.
*   **Urban-Nature Integration:** People live in **ecologically friendly cities** featuring abundant greenery and preserved natural habitats.
*   **Participative Efficacy:** The society functions through the belief that **ordinary citizens** have the agency to make a meaningful difference in the collective future.
*   **Social Warmth and Morality:** The vision is imbued with high levels of **interpersonal warmth**, benevolence, and social equality.
*   **Institutional Regulation:** Relies on **optimized social institutions** and laws to manage the gap between human desires and limited resources.
*   **Clean Energy Transition:** The society is powered by **clean, sustainable energy** sources to eliminate industrial pollution.
*   **Needs-Based Coordination:** Production is often organized through small-scale communities planning in a **needs-based framework**.

**Adjacent Utopias**
1.  **Primitivist Utopia:** While Modern Green seeks a technologically advanced balance with nature, Primitivism views **science and ecology as contradictory**, favoring a return to a simple, non-technological past.
2.  **Futurist Utopia:** In contrast to the moderation of the Modern Green model, the Futurist prototype focuses on **material abundance and AI-driven maximization**, often viewing nature as secondary or resource-based.
3.  **Religious (Millennial) Utopia:** While Modern Green is a secular project based on human design and technology, the Religious model depends on **supernatural powers** or divine intervention to transform the world.

**Key Anchor Quotes**
1.  "An ecologically friendly urbanised society of the future, where people live in peace and happiness, enjoying a cityscape with trees and plants." [1026: Table 3]
2.  "The Green utopia represents an alternative of 'sufficiency', resolving Davis’ collective problem through restraint and the substitution of non‐material for material satisfactions." [462: Section 2]
3.  "Modern ecological utopias ... envision more inventive ways of using modern technology in an environmentally friendly way." [464: Section 2]
4.  "This society harnesses clean energy sources and sustainable technology to ensure citizens enjoy a healthy natural environment free of pollution." [471: Section 4.2]
5.  "The Green utopia was shown to elicit greater perceptions of participative efficacy, which in turn predicted the increase in social change motivation." [460: Abstract]
