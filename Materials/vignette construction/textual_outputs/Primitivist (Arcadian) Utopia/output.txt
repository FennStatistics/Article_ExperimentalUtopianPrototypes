In this Primitivist (Arcadian) Utopia, people aim for just enough.
Everyday life is like a quiet camp where the land sets the pace.
You see no fences, and homes are open-air shelters beside wild plants and animals.
There are no police, courts, or written laws, and disagreements are settled at the Central Fire.
Because desires stay at natural sufficiency, society achieves peace and ecological stability via ending artificial laws and complex technology.
With no electricity or digital devices, people use basic hand tools and share food without contracts.
This organizing principle keeps coordination local, natural, and calmly self-managed.
